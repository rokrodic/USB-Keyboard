# USB-Keyboard
Firmware for Arduino pro micro - USB keyboard (usage: teleprompter, programming, gaming...)

Sources for the video: DIY USB keyboard.
I needed a simple USB keyboard for recording my videos. I read from teleprompter. I use it with my foot. Ordinary keyboards have keys to close.
I also use it for hard to remember programming shortcuts. The other usage I can think of is gaming...
